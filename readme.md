# Multi-Process Encryption System

This project implements a multi-process encryption system using the Vigenère cipher. It is composed of three Python programs:

- **logger.py**: Logs all activity to a specified log file.
- **encryption.py**: Encrypts and decrypts strings using a Vigenère cipher.
- **driver.py**: Provides an interactive menu for the user, coordinates communication between the logger and encryption programs, and maintains a session history.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6.5 or higher**  
  The project has been tested on Python 2.7.5. It will run on MobaXterm’s cs1 server which has Python version 2.7.5.
- **MobaXterm or a similar terminal environment** (if working on a remote server).

## Project Setup

1. **Transfer or Clone the Project Files**:  
   - **Using Git (recommended):**  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
     ```
   - **Manually:** Copy the files (`logger.py`, `encryption.py`, `driver.py`, and this README.md) to your working directory on the cs1 server.
